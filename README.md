# StudentPerformancePredictor
This is my first machine learning project. It predicts the possible marks a student could get given the number of courses the student take and the amount of time (in hours) they commit to studying.

Its predictions are still not very accurate. I am still fine-tuning but the success of this is one giant leap for me. It opens up a career of building machine learning models that would enhance the teaching and learning process in our educational institutions.
